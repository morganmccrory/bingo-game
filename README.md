# Ruby Bingo Game
You can play this game in your terminal simply by running the file.
Features I would like to add, when time permits:
- a second board as the "Computer" player that you are playing against
- increase user interaction with the game, maybe by requiring "yes" or "no" to continue picking bingo numbers
